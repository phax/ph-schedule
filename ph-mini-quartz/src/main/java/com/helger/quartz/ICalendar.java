/**
 * An interface to be implemented by objects that define spaces of time during
 * which an associated <code>{@link ITrigger}</code> may (not) fire. Calendars
 * do not define actual fire times, but rather are used to limit a
 * <code>Trigger</code> from firing on its normal schedule if necessary. Most
 * Calendars include all times by default and allow the user to specify times to
 * exclude.
 * <p>
 * As such, it is often useful to think of Calendars as being used to
 * <I>exclude</I> a block of time - as opposed to <I>include</I> a block of
 * time. (i.e. the schedule &quot;fire every five minutes except on
 * Sundays&quot; could be implemented with a <code>SimpleTrigger</code> and a
 * <code>WeeklyCalendar</code> which excludes Sundays)
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Implementations MUST take care of being properly <code>Cloneable</code> and
 * <code>Serializable</code>.
